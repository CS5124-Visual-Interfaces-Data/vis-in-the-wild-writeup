# Simple Website Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a simple website designed to present a visualization tool. It includes various sections that explain the purpose of the visualization, the data used, the target audience, insights that can be derived, design choices, and limitations of the visualization.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the webpage and includes Bootstrap for styling.
- **css/styles.css**: Custom CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the site.
- **js/script.js**: JavaScript code for interactive features, such as toggling the side panel.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**: 
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it using your preferred web browser.

## Dependencies
